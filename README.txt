Python code to calculate the mean of all output files generated by 
batch_template_new.sh. This new version of the shell script auto-
matically moves all output files of the ensemble run into the new
folder and disables all ncview commands. Also, the .* are moved 
before the '=' symbol to make sure that the variables are changed 
correctly.

Required input for the python script: directory of your output folder. 
In case your files are in the same directory as the script, type 'here'.

The program asks you which data type (time_series, spectra, 1D_LEM) to 
average and automatically detects the number of ensemble runs and 
configurations. Thereafter, it calculates the mean of all runs for all 
configurations. Those output files are saved in a new folder called
'mean_output' and inside there they are separated by data type folders.
