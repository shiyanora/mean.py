Python code to calculate the mean of all output files generated by 
batch_template.sh + ncl scripts. A version of the shellscript with
ncl commands included can be found in batch_template_nc.sh. Don't
forget to change the directory and system_type.

Required input: directory of your output files. In case your files
are in the same directory as the script, type 'here'.

The program asks you which data type (time_series, spectra, 1D_LEM) 
to average and automatically detects the number of ensemble runs
and configurations. Thereafter, it calculates the mean of all runs 
for all configurations.
